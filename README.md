# Autonomous-Robot-Programs
THis repository contains C++ programs to acomplish various navigational tasks for the Coylebot robot as part of the requirement of the ME503 class. The programs were developed using the online MBED compiler for the the MBED LPC1768 processor utilising a host of sensors including IMU, GPS and IR sensors. 

Taks include wall following, GPS navigation, line following and path planning and obstacle avoidance.

A kinematic simulation of the robot has also been included. For this file to run please make sure you include the robot.mat file in the same directory as the kinematic_Simulation_Robot.mat file.

A video of the path planning alogrithm and its traversal has been included
